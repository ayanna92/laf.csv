  - **Random Algorithm:**
   * open the file random_algorithm.py in atom 
   * remove # from line 121, 113 & 114
   * run the file 
   * the results of the random algorthm will be printed
   
      - *extra setup to visualize a certain room of the random schedule:* 
        * make sure to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
        * in random_algorithm remove # in line 117
